# Tetris

This project is a classic implementation of the popular Tetris (NES version) game using Python, opengl, glfw. Only pixel drawing has been used.

## Requirements

Before you can run the Tetris game, you'll need to install the necessary dependencies. The required packages are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

### Installing Dependencies

You can install the dependencies using either `pip` or `conda`.

#### Using `pip`

To install the dependencies with `pip`, you'll need to have `pip` installed on your machine. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `requirements.txt` file is located. Run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Using `conda`

If you prefer to use `conda`, ensure you have `conda` installed. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `requirements.txt` file is located. Run the following command:

```bash
conda install --file requirements.txt
```

## Running the Game

Once you've installed the dependencies, you can run the Tetris game by executing the `tetris.py` file. Use the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
python tetris.py
```

This will start the game, and you'll be presented with the starting screen where the controls are explained.

Enjoy playing Tetris!
